This Project implements a hydraulic erosion algorithm for heightmaps based on the paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4392715. The algorithm runs via Compute Shaders on the GPU for improved performance.

The implementation uses Unity, mostly for rendering and user interaction. The underlying algorithm is hardware independant due to using GPGPU. 

This was done as part of my bachelor thesis in applied computer science at Ravensburg-Weingarten University. My thesis is included in the repository
